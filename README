# TapeSerializer

TapeSerializer is a tool for serializing Ubisoft's TAPE files for Just Dance 2016, Just Dance 2017, Just Dance 2018, Just Dance 2019 and Just Dance 2020 (New-Gen) to make them play-able for Old-Gen versions of the game.

## Installation

You need to download the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
In the installation of Python, please select ADD TO %PATH% and finish the installation.

After it's completely done, open CMD with typing CMD in your search bar or just using 
CTRL + R combination to open **Run** and type CMD.

Now, we have to install these extensions to make the serializer work.

## Usage

Put your New-Gen tapes in the same folder as the .py files and run the script that fits your files'

and you are done! Have fun.
